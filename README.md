Data visualization for PM Aawas Yojna data, and getting insights about the data.

This is My first small project. Where I have tried to visualize the data for Pradhan mantri aawas yojna.

The dataset is available publically on data.gov.in portal.

I have cleaned aligned and visualize the data accross different values and worked with seaborn and plotly libraries to map the
data for better understanding.

The data contains state, district, panchayat and block level house allotment data under the PMAY.

The primary details extracted are:
1. State wise West Bengal is the biggest beneficiary of the scheme
2. Communitiy wise SC and ST community gets 20% of the alloted houses and Minority get 13% remaining 47% is alloted to other.
3. Data for Delhi and Chandigadh is not available.

I will be working on the data to get more insights as I learn and discover further.

Allways open to learn. please let me know any of shortcomings or improvment that could be done.
